As long as I did not find the start code from the course repository,
I could not access the original files like, requirements.txt and pyproject.toml. 
Hence, I listed all the packages I used in the requirements.txt made by myself. undoubtedly,
 as the formate or syntax is not correct, it cannot be run by using pip install -r requirements.txt.
 I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused by that.
